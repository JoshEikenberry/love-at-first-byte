# Maple Glazed Roast Pumpkin

## Ingredients
2 lb / 1 kg pumpkin (whole, unpeeled)  
2 red onions, peeled and each onion cut into 12 wedges  
1/4 cup walnuts, roughly chopped (see note below)  
3 tbsp maple syrup, or honey or brown sugar (see note below)  
3 tbsp olive oil  
1 tbsp dried chili flakes, adjust to taste - flavour becomes milder when roasted  
1/2 tsp salt  
pinch of black pepper  

## Instructions
1. reheat oven to 200C/390F.
2. Peel and dice the pumpkin into 1"/2.5cm cubes (no need to peel if using squash or butternut pumpkin). Reserve the pumpkin seeds and give them a quick rinse under the tap.
3. Place the pumpkin, pumpkin seeds, onion and walnuts onto a large baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil and maple syrup, then use an egg flip to toss the pumpkin so it is evenly coated.
4. Sprinkle the pumpkin with the dried chilli flakes, salt and pepper.
5. Roast for 25 minutes, or until the pumpkin is browned and cooked through. Toss once at around 15 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven, crumble over feta and garnish with fresh chili and parsley, if using. Serve immediately.

## Note

* You can use whatever nuts you prefer but just be aware that you might need to adjust the cooking time i.e. toss them in partway through roasting. Walnuts hold up well in the oven for the full roasting time. Almonds, peanuts and cashews will also be fine for the full time. If using pine nuts, sunflower seeds or pepitas (or other small nuts), add them halfway through the roasting time.
* If you use brown sugar instead of honey or maple syrup, mix it with the olive oil before pouring over the pumpkin.
